# Habitat Preferences by Sex of Oregon Spotted Frogs | Week 31 - 2022, TidyTuesday
My contribution to week 31 TidyTuesday: a statistical look at the habitat preferences of Oregon Spotted Frogs.

## Description

This week's #TidyTuesday featured a dataset on observations of Oregon Spotted Frogs, including such features as habitat, sex, water, etc. 
I decided to visualize the observations by gender and habitat type, specifically using statistics to judge if habitat preferences are the same between male and 
female frogs. 

The exporatory data analysis and subsequent data visualization communicated that male frogs are much more likely to frequent rivers while females are found more 
often in ponds and reservoirs.

I was able to practice several data viz principles through this project: multiple plots in a single data viz and rastering a table as an image.
Refer to the .R file for a walkthrough of creating the visualization.

## Core Packages I Use
{ggplot2} for core data visualization

{patchwork} for assembling the various plots

{flextable} for designing the table and converting it to a rasterable image

{camcorder} to produce the final PNG

Additional {tidyverse} packages for data manipulation
